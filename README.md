- 👋 Hi, I’m @CybersealCaleb777
- 👀 I’m interested in computers how to hijack and takeover Iran's drones so innocent people won't get hurt or killed. Also I know how you can hijack planes computer systems with a crappy windows operating system. I'm the first cyber commando that usa has to defend there networks from cyberterrorism
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  everything about cyber warfare...and cyber warfare.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that does cyber world safety on usa and Israel networks and to counter dangerous  cyber states.
- 📫 How to reach me know that I did this on mobile phone I'm the first cyberseal on usa territory. Reach me at calebrodgers2@gmail.com and  notice to the Defense.gov you can't arrest me on here or thwart my activities because if you do innocent people in the future will die pentagon such as your military planes dropping from the sky and air force one plane systems being hacked into. GitHub has full rights to make this info public and to interview me on my email address for more info on what i prevented in 2009. I would like to be contacted by GitHub founder in my personal email address and if I'm assassinated innocent people will die and cyberterrorism will be a reality worldwide especially on usa and Israel soil.
